# TODO: MOVE tHIS STUFF TO JSON/MARKS
## to parse JSON
just choose what "type" you have at each level, and use the various piece functions to parse it

## parsing different types of JSON action/input with a mark
see `grab` here:
https://github.com/yosoyubik/canvas/blob/master/urbit/mar/canvas/view.hoon
then see how it uses `dejs` here:
https://github.com/yosoyubik/canvas/blob/master/urbit/lib/canvas.hoon#L10

## poke can use ANY mark--just has to be in `/mar`
